# üçî Food Image Classification using CNN (Food-101 Dataset)

A deep learning project that builds and trains a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify food images into 101 categories using the **Food-101 dataset**, implemented in **TensorFlow** and developed on **Google Colab**.

---

## üéØ Objective

To build a CNN model capable of classifying food images into 101 different categories using the Food-101 dataset, with a focus on model performance, augmentation, and visualization.

## ‚ú® Key Features

1. **Uses the Food-101 Dataset**
   - Benchmark dataset with **101,000 images** across 101 food categories.
   - Loaded using `tensorflow_datasets` for streamlined access.

2. **TensorFlow-based CNN Model**
   - Custom **CNN architecture** built from scratch using `tf.keras.Sequential()`.

3. **Data Augmentation**
   - Improves generalization with techniques like **flipping**, **rotating**, and **zooming**.

4. **Training and Validation Visualization**
   - Real-time plotting of training/validation **accuracy** and **loss** using `matplotlib`.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Assessed using accuracy/loss curves and validation set performance.
   - Visualizes predictions for sample test images.
